# How to contribute

If you found a bug or issue, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching in
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/SymphonyPlatformSolutions/generator-symphony/issues).
If you are unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one.
Be sure to include a title and clear description, the SDK version, and a code sample demonstrating the issue.

If you open a PR to fix any issue, please reference the ticket in the PR title.
A [Symphony SDK team](https://github.com/orgs/SymphonyPlatformSolutions/teams/symphony-sdk/members) member
will have to approve before it is merged and eventually released.

If you want to request an enhancement or feature, please open a Github issue if none has been opened before.
New feature requests on the legacy SDK will not be accepted.
